/*Currently akimbos are seperate weapons from their single variants.
Each pistol has its own ammo counter, and when one becomes empty before the
other then only the one with ammo will be fired. The right pistol has its 
ammo synched with the single pistol, and because of this akimbos should 
always give the player an equivalent single pistol. When players throw
akimbos, the right pistol is kept and the left pistol is dropped as a single
variant. When in use, the combined total of the left and right counters are
packed into m_iClip1 for display purposes.

The current implementation is not optimal and is implemented in several 
different places. It would be better to have a single weapon that functions
logically as both single and akimbo and have all the code implemented on it,
but this would require a deal of extra work from what I know.

sdk_player.cpp for drop functional
da_viewmodel.cpp for muzzle flashes
weapon_sdkbase.cpp for pick up behaviour
(probably another one or two as well)

It would be wise to work toward a more unified approach, and one that
supplants this baseclass entirely.*/
